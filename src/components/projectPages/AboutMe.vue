              I am <strong>Niclas</strong>, a software developer from Dresden, Germany. I study computer science at TU Dresden since 2018 and have been working on various projects for the university.
              You can see my personal projects down below.
              <p></p>
              Apart from programming, I enjoy gaming (obviously) and making music. I mainly play League of Legends in amateur leagues (<a href="https://www.primeleague.gg/de/leagues/teams/112448-davids-salt-miners">link to my team here</a>)
              and osu! (<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9329597">my profile here</a>). My music is released on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/moonlvnd">SoundCloud</a>.
